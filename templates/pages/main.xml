<p>MArcomage (Multiplayer Arcomage) is an online card game inspired by original Arcomage. It's possible to play either against a human player or a computer player. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcomage">Arcomage</a> is a fantasy turn-based card game. This card game simulates an epic battle between two empires including features such as constructing new buildings, training troops and decimating the enemy empire with standard attacks or sneaky tactics such as intrigue or spells. There are similarities in gameplay, but there are differences in cards, game rules and victory conditions.</p>

<p>Advantage of this game is its turn based play style. It allows players to play as often as they like. For example you can play few turns a day, but if you want, you can play all the time, provided you find an opponent willing to play all day as well.</p>
