<p>Arcomage is a fantasy turn-based card game. This card game simulates an epic battle between two empires including features such as constructing new buildings, training troops and decimating the enemy empire with standard attacks or sneaky tactics such as intigue or spells. MArcomage is its online version for two human players.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p><a style="float: right;" href="img/screen_start_game.png"><img src="img/screen_start_game_s.png" alt="start game screen"/></a>The game consists of rounds. Round consists of turns. In most cases one round consists of only one turn, but some cards allow player to make additional turns in the same round. In one turn a player can play one card. Then the next turn follows. After end of player's round it's his opponent's round, where he gets to play card(s). This way the players play the game - always one playing cards and the other one waiting for the next round where he can play cards. The cards themselves modify some attributes of the game (such as tower and wall height, resources ...). The game is very simple and easy to operate. There is much information on the game screen, we will now describe some basic information, in the picture to the right. In the upper left of the screen, your login name is written. In the upper part you can see the navigation bar, which is used to travel between sections.</p>
<p>Right below the navigation bar you can see the round indicator, that keeps you informed in which round the game currently is. In the center-left part there is a game list manager. You can use it to jump to another game or you can traverse trough games, in which your turn is, via "Next game" button. In the center of the screen you can see card history. There are no cards there yet, but later it will hold the card(s) recently played by you and your opponent. Above card history is the notice which informs you which player's turn currently is. When waiting for opponent's turn, you need to refresh the game with our refresh button. Furthermore if opponent's name (above the tower and wall information) is colored green it means that he is currently on-line.</p>

<h4>Game attributes: Resources, facilities, resource production, tower and wall</h4>
<p><a style="float: right;" href="img/screen_resources.png"><img src="img/screen_resources_s.png" alt="resources"/></a>Every player has three types of resources: Bricks, Gems and Recruits, and three types of resource production facilities: Quarry, Magic and Dungeon (generating resources in the corresponding order). Bricks are the basic building material, used mostly for constructing buildings. Magic powered soul gems (shortly gems) represent the magical power at your disposal. And finally, recruits represent your living or fighting power (amount of creatures, soldiers and weapons). At the end of round, for each facility of certain type, one resource of the corresponding type is added to the active player's stock. Example: If Quarry = 3, at the end of round, three Bricks will be added to the stock. The number of facilities of any kind cannot drop below one, and the amount of a resource of a certain type cannot be lower than zero. In the picture you can see where resources and facilities info is displayed. Your resources and facilities are to the left and opponent's  are to the right.</p>
<p>Every player has his/her own tower and wall, each having a height. Tower height can be at most 100, wall has height limit 150. In the case of a standard enemy attack, the attack will first lower the wall. Only after the wall height is zero and some attack power still remains will the tower be lowered. Example: Enemy attacks with an attack power of 25, wall height is 10, tower height is 20. After the attack, the wall height will be zero and the tower height will be 5. There are some cards that do damage to the tower directly, bypassing the wall. Tower and wall information are located in the bottom-left part (yours) and bottom-right (opponent's). Moreover, if some of these game attributes were changed due to effect of some card, it will be indicated by a small number next to the effected attribute. Cost of a played card and normal production are not displayed in the changes. Zero production is displayed as a loss of resources.</p>

	<part name="Victory types">
		<![CDATA[			
<p>The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reaching one or more victory conditions. The following outcomes are possible:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>tower destruction</b> - raze the enemy tower to the ground to win - meaning, lower the enemy tower to zero height. Usually achieved by green cards and standard attacks.</li>
	<li><b>tower building</b> - build up your tower to height 100 to win. Usually achieved by delaying enemy attacks while building your tower.</li>
	<li><b>resource accumulation</b> - accumulate 400 of resources (total sum) to win. Beware of cards that cripple your stock.</li>
	<li><b>timeout</b> - each game is limited to 250 rounds. Afterwards, both players' states are compared (in the order: tower, wall, no. of facilities, sum of resources). Whoever has more (in that order), wins. Otherwise the game is declared a draw.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special rules apply in the case where both players achieve a victory condition simultaneously. If the victory type for both is the same, the result is, logically, a draw. If the victory types are different, the following rule is used to determine the winner:</p>
<p>Destruction victory > Tower bulding victory > Resource victory > Timeout victory.</p>
<p>After the game is finished and a player leaves the game, his opponent is informed about this with "player has left the game" message in the chat window.</p>

<h4>Special game end types</h4>
<p>Game can be ended in different way when certain conditions are met.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>surrender</b> - each player can use the "Surrender" button to send a surrender request to his opponent. Surrender request can be cancelled until the opponent accepts or rejects the request. The game will be ended only if he accepts. In such case, player who sent the surrender request will get one loss point and his opponent will get one victory point.</li>
	<li><b>abort</b> - when your opponent becomes dead, i.e. does not log in for more than three weeks, you may use the "Abort game" button to end the game. In this case neither you nor your opponent gain victory or loss points - the score remains unchanged.</li>
	<li><b>finish</b> - if your opponent doesn't make his turn for more than three weeks and he doesn't become dead, you may use the "Finish game" button to end the game. In this case you'll get one victory point and opponent one loss point.</li>
</ul>

	<part name="Cards">
		<![CDATA[
<p><img style="float: right" src="img/screen_card.png" alt="card"/>Every card has a name, a price and an effect. The name and the price are found in the upper part of the card, the effect in the lower part, below the card picture. The price is the amount of resources needed for a card to be played, each type of resource represented by the color related to the resource. This amount will be subtracted from the resource stock when the card is played. The card can only be played if you have enough resources to pay for its price. After a card is played, its effect will take place. Every card belongs to some group, indicated by the card's border color. There are three groups: Common, Uncommon and Rare. Common cards have green border, Uncommon brown and Rare yellow. Every player has exactly eight cards in his or hers hand. Your cards are located at the upper part of the screen. Opponent's cards are located in the bottom part of the screen. You can see enemy's cards in his or hers hand.</p>
<p>Some cards in yours/opponent's hand are marked with "New card" flag. This indicates that this card has been received to the hand only recently. You may want to pay close attention to these cards. In the middle of the game screen are cards last played by each player (it can be very important). In one turn one player plays one card or a player can discard a card instead of playing it. When a card is discarded, its cost is not payed, but its effect will not happen. After a card(s) has been played or discarded a new card(s) will be added to player's hand. The new card will be chosen randomly from the card groups with probabilities 65% for Common, 29% for Uncommon and 6% for Rare, unless a played card says otherwise. Rares can't be drawn after <b>Quick</b> or <b>Swift</b> cards.</p>

<p>When drawing new card, the system takes into account cards on current player's hand. The system reduces the probability of stocking multiple instances of the same card in hand by doing this procedure:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a random card according to the current rules (depends on draw procedure type)</li>
	<li>Count number of instances (= N) of new card already present in hand (played position doesn't count)</li>
	<li>Select the new card as chosen with probability of 1/(2^{N}) (i.e. reject the new card with probability of 1 - (1/(2^{N}))</li>
	<li>If a card was rejected return to 1, if it was chosen end procedure</li>
</ol>

<p>The probability that you will end up with multiple card instances is exponentially decreasing with number of instances. We call this the anti-flood mechanism. Let's look at some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If there are no card instances (N = 0), the card is chosen with 100% probability</li>
	<li>If there is one card instance (N = 1), the card is chosen with 50% probability</li>
	<li>If there are two card instances (N = 2), the card is chosen with 25% probability</li>
	<li>If there are three card instances (N = 3), the card is chosen with 12.5% probability</li>
	<li>If there are four card instances (N = 4), the card is chosen with 6.25% probability</li>
</ul>

<p>Some cards have modes. If a card has more modes, it means it can be played with different effects. The effects are described on the card. For example card Merchant will add 6 bricks, when played in Mode1, 5 gems when played in Mode2 or 5 recruits, when played in mode3. When you can play such card, there is a mode selector next to the play button. Simply select the chosen mode of the card and play it. Some cards discard other cards from yours or opponents hand. Cards that where discarded during your last round are located to the left of the card history. Cards that were discarded during opponent's last round are shown to the right of the card history. One pile of discarded cards are further divided into cards that were discarded from your hand (located on the left of yellow vertical line) and cards that were discarded from opponent's hand (located on the right of yellow vertical line). Both card history and discarded cards are ordered in this fashion: last played/discarded are the leftmost.</p>

	<part name="Tokens">
		<![CDATA[
<p>Some keywords have a side-effect, that requires a token counter. Player can choose up to three token counters for each deck in the deck section. It is possible to assign the token counters automatically by selecting the "Auto" button. When deck is completed and no token counters are set, token counters will be chosen automatically. Playing a card with keyword, which is associated with the token counter, will raise the value of the token counter. The number of tokens received varies with each keyword (see the Keyword section above). When a token counter reaches 100 or more by playing a card with that keyword a side-effect will happen and the token counter will be reset to 0. This side-effect takes place directly after the card effect of the played card. Each token-associated keyword has a token gain. This information tells you how many tokens are gained when card with such keyword is played. Token gain consists of basic gain (number of tokens you get for the played card) and bonus gain (number of tokens you gain for each additional card in hand with the same keyword as the played card). Keywords with high basic gain are generally better used as support keywords, since they don't require to have many cards with the same keyword in hand, however their token gains might not be very high. Keywords with high bonus gain require many cards with the same keyword, but when there are such cards in hand, token gains can be very high.</p>

<p>Let's take the <b>Alliance</b> keyword for example. First you need to set one token counter to <b>Alliance</b> keyword (in the deck section). Then you normally start a game with this deck. <b>Alliance</b> keyword has 17 basic gain and 3 bonus gain. So, when you play a card that has <b>Alliance</b> keyword, it will raise the <b>Alliance</b> token counter by 17 plus 3 for each additional <b>Alliance</b> card in hand. When the counter reaches 100, it will add a Production x2 to the effect of the played card and will be reset to 0. By paying close attention to the token counters, you will be able to make good combos of card effects and keyword side-effects. For example <b>Soldier</b> and <a href="?location=Cards_details&amp;card=102">Ceremonial guard</a> or <b>Alliance</b> and <a href="?location=Cards_details&amp;card=375">Stilshrine of Miriam</a> can make good stock boosting combos.</p>

<p>Let's look at another example. <a href="?location=Cards_details&amp;card=121">Luna the Sorceress</a> has both <b>Mage</b> and <b>Far sight</b> keywords. Under certain conditions <b>Far sight</b> keyword is able to raise the value of the <b>Mage</b> token counter as well. When Luna the Sorceress is played, following can happen:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Mage</b> keyword raises the value of the <b>Mage</b> token counter, but not to 100</li>
	<li><b>Far sight</b> keyword raises the value of the <b>Mage</b> token counter to 100</li>
	<li>the <b>Mage</b> keyword side effect is not triggered despite the fact, that <b>Mage</b> token counter reached 100</li>
</ol>

<p>Why? Keywords are always executed in a <a href="?location=Help&amp;help_part=Keywords">fixed order</a>. In this case <b>Mage</b> keyword first, <b>Far sight</b> keyword second. Only the <b>Mage</b> keyword can trigger its side-effect. When the effect took place, the <b>Mage</b> token counter value didn't reach 100. <b>Far sight</b> keyword raised it to 100 later, but too late for the side-effect to happen. In this case, you need to play another card with <b>Mage</b> keyword to activate the <b>Mage</b> keyword side-effect.</p>

<p>Deck section contains list of all decks. For each deck it is possible to see date and time of last modification, so you can tell how old each deck is. To enter deck details click on the deck name. If deck is ready for use (contains 45 cards), its name is highlighted in green color.</p>
<p><a style="float: right;" href="img/screen_deck_building.png"><img src="img/screen_deck_building_s.png" alt="deck building section"/></a>Deck consists of 15 different cards from each group. A deck name must be different to all your other decks. Deck building section consits of control bar, where buttons that provide deck modifications and card pool modifications (filters), are located. On the left part this bar, there are filters. You can use them to filter out the unnecessary cards from the card pool. When a filter is active, it's border color is highlighted with lime color. There are five filters (all of them can be combined):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Class filter - selects either Common, Uncommon or Rare cards</li>
	<li>Keyword filter - selects cards that have specified keyword</li>
	<li>Cost filter - selects cards that have specified cost</li>
	<li>Advanced filter - selects cards that have specified card effect</li>
	<li>Support filter - selects cards that are supportive for selected keyword (i.e. they have the selected keyword mentioned in the card effect text)</li>
	<li>Creation date filter - selects cards that were added on a specific date</li>
	<li>Modification date filter - selects cards that were modified on a specific date</li>
</ul>

<p>Just set the filters and then push the "Apply filters" button. Number of cards per row can be customized in the Settings section. To hide/show card pool click on the Hide/Show card pool button. On the right part of the bar, there are following buttons: Rename and Reset. To rename deck, simply write the name in the text window and click the "Rename deck" button. If you want to empty your deck just push the "Reset" button. Finnaly the rightmost is the average cost indicator. It shows you the average price of card per turn. Please do note that this calculation does only take into account card cost, not it's effect. Below is your deck. When bulding a deck, each of the 45 card slots is occupied either by some card or just with an 'Empty' card (signalling an empty card slot). You can transfer a card from card pool by clicking on the card (or pushing Take button under the card you want to select when JavaScript is disabled).</p>

<p>If you want to remove a card from your deck, also click on the card (or push the Return button under the card when JavaScript is disabled) you whish to be removed. Any changes to the deck are immediately recorded, so it is possible to leave the deck incomplete. Such a deck cannot be used to play a game, though. When starting a game you must choose a deck from the deck list by selecting its name. There is a maximum of eight decks total for one player.</p>

<p>To save deck slots, player can export decks into data files with "Export" button. When such exported deck is needed, player can load it from data file with "Import" button.</p>

	<part name="New game">
		<![CDATA[
<p>You can start a new game in two ways. First, you can challenge someone to a game by selecting the challenge button in the User screen, which is in the same line as the player, who you want to challenge. The other option is to go to player's details and challenge him from there. Then you need to choose the deck with which you want to play the game. Second, you can wait until someone else challenges you and then accept the challenge. Before accepting the challenge you also need to choose a deck, with which you want to play. The player which goes first is randomly chosen. To compensate for disadvantage of going second, the other player is given one from each resource in addition to his starting stock.</p>
<p>There is a limit of max. 15 <i>simultaneous</i> games (this also includes hosted games), and only one game per opponent which you initiated (this implies that you can only have 2 parallel games against each person). Incoming and outgoing challenges count as games, so try to accept or reject them as soon as possible. This limit can be raised by gaining higher levels. There is no restriction to the number of games played per day or against someone, you can play any way you like.</p>

<p>Alternative way to start a game is to host a game. This can be done in the games section. Select game modes and then use the "Host game" button. When game is hosted any player can join and then the game starts. This way you don't choose the opponent, but the opponent chooses you. When you host or join a game, you must select one of your decks. In both cases the deck selector is located above the games list on the left.</p>
<p>When you have a game where your turn is, it is indicated by animated image ("crossed swords") in the upper part of the screen (navigation bar).</p>

<p>It is possible to choose from several game modes, when starting a new game:</p>
<ul>
	<li><img width="20px" height="14px" src="img/blind.png" alt="blind flag" class="icon" title="Hidden cards" /> Hide opponent's cards - this mode will disable the ability to see opponent's cards for both players</li>
	<li><img width="20px" height="14px" src="img/friendly_play.png" alt="friendly flag" class="icon" title="Friendly play" /> Friendly play - allows to play games, where the game outcome doesn't effect score or experience of the players</li>
</ul>

<p>Each player can configure his status in settings section. Player status can be seen by other players and can be used to help you find the desired opponent. There are four options available:</p>
<ul>
	<li><img width="20px" height="14px" src="img/ready.png" alt="status flag" class="icon" title="ready" /> Looking for game - you want to play a normal game</li>
	<li><img width="20px" height="14px" src="img/quick.png" alt="status flag" class="icon" title="quick" /> Looking for quick game - you want to play a quick game (play online until the game finishes without interruptions)</li>
	<li><img width="20px" height="14px" src="img/dnd.png" alt="status flag" class="icon" title="dnd" /> Do not disturb - you don't want to play games right now</li>
	<li><img width="20px" height="14px" src="img/newbie.png" alt="status flag" class="icon" title="newbie" /> Newbie - new player, this is the default setting</li>
</ul>
<p>For example if you want to play a quick game, select "Looking for quick game" status. It is possible to use filter in players list section to filter out players with a specific status, so in this case, only players that are looking for a quick game. All icon images have their description displayed when hovering over them with mouse cursor.</p>

	<part name="Player rating system">
		<![CDATA[
<p>Players gather experience by playing games. When enough experience is gathered, a player will gain a new level. Higher level ensures a higher place in the ladder of all players and grants extra game and deck slots. Each 4th level grants a bonus game slot and each 6th level grants bonus deck slot. Based on player's performance in the game, the experience amount is calculated. To level up on the Nth level you need 500 + (50 * N) + (200 * [N/5]) + (100 * [N/10]^{2}) EXP. The [] is operation floor, which is nearest lower integer number (for exmaple: [1] = 1, [1.3] = 1, [1.9] = 1, [2.2] = 2). Base EXP for one game is 100 EXP. Experience calculation is divided into four phases.</p>

<h4>First phase: Game rating</h4>
<p>From the perspective of one player the game can have several outcomes, each of them is handled separately. Below, there is a list of experience modifiers - one for each game outcome. This modifier applies onto the base EXP.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Victory - Resource accumulation: 115%</li>
	<li>Victory - Tower building: 110%</li>
	<li>Victory - Tower destruction: 105%</li>
	<li>Victory - Abandon: 100%</li>
	<li>Victory - Surrender: 95%</li>
	<li>Victory - Timeout: 60%</li>
	<li>Draw: 50%</li>
	<li>Loss - Timeout: 40%</li>
	<li>Loss - Tower destruction: 15%</li>
	<li>Loss - Tower building: 10%</li>
	<li>Loss - Resource accumulation: 5%</li>
	<li>Loss - Surrender: 0%</li>
	<li>Loss - Abandon: 0%</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if Player1 won with Tower destruction victory, he will gain 105EXP. His opponent will gain only 15EXP. Lets give one more example. Player1 won with Timeout victory, he will gain 60EXP. His opponent will gain 40EXP. This EXP, which we recently computed, is not the EXP the players gain. This is the input to the next phase.</p>

<h4>Second phase: Opponent rating</h4>

<p>This phase deals with players' levels. The idea behind this phase is really simple. When you beat an opponent of higher level than yours, you get EXP bonus. On the other hand if you beat opponent of lower level than yours, you get EXP penalty.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If opponent's level is higher than yours, you get 10% EXP bonus for each opponent's level above yours. The amount of bonus is limited to 100% max.</li>
	<li>If opponent's level is same as yours, you don't get EXP bonus or EXP penalty.</li>
	<li>If opponent's level is lower than yours, you get 5% EXP penalty for each of your level that you are above opponent. The amount of penalty is limited to 50% max.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see an example. We take Player1 with 105 EXP. Player1 has level 7, Player2 has level 1. Now, let's compute the outcome. Player1 is 6 levels above Player2, so he gets 6 * 5% penalty, so it's 30% EXP penalty total. That leaves him with 105 * 0.7 =  74EXP (rounded). Player2 gets a bonus for 6 levels. He gets 6 * 10% bonus, 60% EXP bonus total. That leaves him with 10 * 1.6 = 24EXP.</p>

<h4>Third phase: Victory rating</h4>

<p>Main idea is to rate how close the victory was. The condition depends on the victory type. There are three victory ratings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Major achievement - 75% EXP bonus</li>
	<li>Minor achievement - 25% EXP bonus</li>
	<li>Tactical achievement - no EXP bonus</li>
</ul>

<p>Table below explains how are victory ratings achieved. The system evaluates how close the victory was, by rating how close it was for each victory type. There are two cases, each explained separately.</p>

<h4>In case of victory</h4>

<p>Minimum is computed from all victory ratings. For example, if Resource accumulation was evaluated "Major", Tower building was evaluated "Minor" and Tower destruction was evaluated "Minor", the final result will be "Minor". If you want to achieve Major victory you need to satisfy condition for Major victory of all three types.</p>

<table class="centered skin_text" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<th>Major</th>
		<th>Minor</th>
		<th>Tactical</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Resource accumulation</th>
		<td>Enemy stock below 150</td>
		<td>Enemy stock between 150 and 300</td>
		<td>Enemy stock above 300</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Tower building</th>
		<td>Enemy tower below 30</td>
		<td>Enemy tower between 30 and 60</td>
		<td>Enemy tower above 60</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Tower destruction</th>
		<td>Tower above 60</td>
		<td>Tower between 30 and 60</td>
		<td>Tower below 30</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h4>In case of draw or loss</h4>

<p>Maximum is computed from all victory ratings. For example, if Resource accumulation was evaluated "Major", Tower building was evaluated "Minor" and Tower destruction was evaluated "Minor", the final result will be "Major". If you want to achieve Major victory you need to satisfy condition for Major victory of at least one of the three types.</p>

<table class="centered skin_text" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<th>Major</th>
		<th>Minor</th>
		<th>Tactical</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Resource accumulation</th>
		<td>Stock above 300</td>
		<td>Stock between 150 and 300</td>
		<td>Stock below 150</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Tower building</th>
		<td>Tower above 60</td>
		<td>Tower between 30 and 60</td>
		<td>Tower below 30</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Tower destruction</th>
		<td>Enemy tower below 30</td>
		<td>Enemy tower between 30 and 60</td>
		<td>Enemy tower above 60</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h4>Fourth phase: Awards</h4>

<p>This phase effects only the victor and allows you to gather extra EXP when certain conditions are satisfied. Any number of awards can be collected.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gentle touch (20% EXP) - win by playing a common card</li>
	<li>Desolator (30% EXP) - win while enemy facilities = 1</li>
	<li>Titan (45% EXP) - win with the <b>Titan</b> set</li>
	<li>Assassin (50% EXP) - win within 10 rounds</li>
	<li>Collector (70% EXP) - win with at least 4 rare cards in hand (played card doesn't count)</li>
	<li>Builder (80% EXP) - win with maximum wall</li>
	<li>Survivor (90% EXP) - win with 1 tower and 0 wall</li>
</ul>

<p>After the game the system will send you a message about the outcome of the game - a game report (when battle reports option is active). It will show you how much EXP you got in each phase and how much EXP did you get in the end. Also, when you gain next level, the system will sent you an information message about it.</p>

	<li>Most discarded - Top 10 most discarded cards, this statistic is updated each time a card is discarded by standard discard or by card effect</li>
	<li>Least played - Top 10 least played cards, this statistic is updated each time a card is played</li>
	<li>Least discarded - Top 10 least discarded cards, this statistic is updated each time a card is discarded by standard discard or by card effect</li>
	<li>Most drawn - Top 10 most drawn cards, this statistic is updated each time a card is drawn by any draw type</li>
	<li>Least drawn - Top 10 least drawn cards, this statistic is updated each time a card is drawn by any draw type</li>
	<li>Skins - for each skin type (layout setting), the usage ratio is shown (how many players use that skin compared to total skins used), only active and offline players contribute to this statistic</li>
	<li>Game modes - the percentage shown is how many games use the respective game mode (compared to all games in total), only finished games contribute to this statistic</li>
	<li>Victory types - for each victory type, the percentage ratio is shown (how many games ended with the respective victory type compared to all games in total), only finished games contribute to this statistic</li>
	<li>Backgrounds - for each background type (layout setting), the usage ratio is shown (how many players use that background compared to total backgrounds used), only active and offline players contribute to this statistic</li>
	<li>Suggested concepts - Top 10 authors of suggested card concepts (only card concepts with status "waiting" and "interesting" are counted)</li>
	<li>Implemented concepts - Top 10 authors of implemented card concepts (only card concepts with status "implemented" are counted)</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between "lastest" and "overall" statistics is the fact that "lastest" statistics are reset every time new cards are added to provide fair competition between new and old cards. "overall" statistics are never reset, so the older the card, the bigger is the advantage compared to new, younger cards. Default length of card statistics list is 10, but this can be changed via the card list length selector at the top of the statistics page. Usage factor is calculated for each card to compare card usage to other cards of the same rarity.</p>

<h4>Versus statistics</h4>

<p>Versus statistics are available in the player's details section. These statistics show information about games where two players played against each other (first player is the one viewing the player's details section and second player is the one being viewed). Statistics are calculated from the first player perspective. When viewing own profile, player's overall game statistics are shown instead of Versus statistics.</p>
