('faq', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '<h4>Q1: I have noticed some unexpected behaviour from the system, I think I have found a bug. What should I do now?</h4>\r\n<p>A: Go trough F.A.Q. first and if you can''t find your answer there please document the bug (screenshot, page source) and send it to either <a href="mailto:illuminati@pobox.sk">Mojko</a> or <a href="mailto:theultramage@gmail.com">theultramage</a>. In the e-mail, try to describe the bug itself, then the circumstances in which the bug appeared. Another option is to use our bug tracking system at <a href="https://netvor.sk/trac/arcomage">https://netvor.sk/trac/arcomage</a>. We will do what we can to solve the problem.</p>\r\n<h4>Q2: I can''t log in. How do I fix that?</h4>\r\n<p>A: If you are sure you have used the right login and password, try to delete cookies for our site in your browser. You should find cookie management in options/preferences/advanced options.</p>\r\n<h4>Q3: My browser doesn''t display your site properly. You have errors in your website. Can you fix it?</h4>\r\n<p>A: We made this website according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> standards, so the cause is most likely the browser you''re using. We know that IE7, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/?from=getfirefox">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> have no problems displaying it, perhaps you could try using one. Writing a report might not be a bad idea, too - it would help us make future plans.</p>\r\n<h4>Q4: When I play a card, its cost should be subtracted from my stock, but it isn''t. I ended up with more resources than I should have. Why is that?</h4>\r\n<p>A: The card cost is always the same as it is displayed on the card. There is no way these two values would differ. So you probably didn''t realize that after the card is played (at the end of your turn), you get resources from your facilities. This is probably the reason why you ended up with more resources than you expected.</p>\r\n<h4>Q5: What is a turn anyway? How it works?</h4>\r\n<p>A: Turn is one elementary step in a game you are playing. A turn consits of these steps:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Cost of a card is substracted</li>\r\n	<li>Effect of the card takes place</li>\r\n	<li>Keywords with side-effects apply</li>\r\n	<li>Resource production</li>\r\n	<li>Game limits apply (resources cannot be lower then 0, wall below 0, facitlies below 1...)</li>\r\n	<li>End game condition is checked</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>Q6: I played an if-then-else card, fulfilling the condition, but instead the secondary effect took place. Why?</h4>\r\n<p>A: Remember that this condition is evaluated AFTER the card cost is subtracted from your stock. This may be the reason why the secondary effect was chosen.</p>\r\n<h4>Q7: I played a "Swift" card and I got an unexpected increase of resources. How does a "Swift" card work?</h4>\r\n<p>A: Simple - by playing a "Swift" card you get a full extra turn, including resource production.</p>\r\n<h4>Q8: Is the number of "Swift"/"Quick" cards played in a row limited?</h4>\r\n<p>A: No. You can make arbitrarily long chains of "Swift"/"Quick" cards.</p>\r\n<h4>Q9: I used F5 to refresh the game and for some reason a card was played by itself.</h4>\r\n<p>A: Use OUR refresh button (located on the upper right part of the screen), not the one on the browser. For quick access use shorcut ALT+w.</p>\r\n<h4>Q10: I played a card ("Master of past" for example) that reverses or undos some effect of opponents last played card and it didn''t work like it should have.</h4>\r\n<p>A: You probably played such card after "Swift"/"Quick" card(s). So when you played it, the system no longer had the information what effect was caused by opponent''s last turn. There is an easy rule for these cards - if you want them to work fine, don''t play them after any "Swift"/"Quick" cards.</p>\r\n<h4>Q11: Some cards have "recently discarded cards" in their effect. What does that mean?</h4>\r\n<p>A: Recently discarded cards are following cards:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Card discarded by you with discard button last turn</li>\r\n	<li>Cards that were discarded by you last turn by some card effect</li>\r\n	<li>Cards that were discarded by opponent last turn by some card effect</li>\r\n</ul>'),
('help', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '<p>\r\nArcomage is a fantasy turn-based card game.\r\nThis card game simulates an epic battle between two empires including features such as constructing new buildings, training troops and decimating the enemy empire with standard attacks or sneaky tactics such as intigue or spells.\r\nMArcomage is its online version for two human players.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Overview</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n<a style="float: right;" href="img/screen_start_game.png"><img src="img/screen_start_game_s.png" alt="start game screen"/></a>\r\nThe game consists of turns. In one turn a player can play one card. Then the next turn follows, where the other player can play cards.\r\nThis way the players play the game - always one playing cards and the other one waiting for the next turn where he can play cards.\r\nThe cards themselves modify some attributes of the game (such as tower and wall height, resources ...).\r\nThe game is very simple and easy to operate. There is much information on the game screen, we will now describe some basic information, in the picture to the right. In the upper left of the screen, your login name is written. In the upper part you can see the navigation bar, which is used to travel between sections. Right below the navigation bar you can see the round indicator, that keeps you informed in which round the game currently is. In the center-left part there is a game list manager. You can use it to jump to another game or you can traverse trough games, in which your turn is, via "Next game" button. In the center of the screen you can see card history. There are no cards there yet, but later it will hold the card(s) recently played by you and your opponent. Above card history is the notice which informs you which player''s turn currently is. Furthermore if opponent''s name is colored white it means that he is currently on-line. When waiting for opponent''s turn, you need to refresh the game with our refresh button.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For practice you can <a href="http://www.x-factor.tym.sk/Arcomage/Arcomage.rar">download</a> and play single player Arcomage to learn the basics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Game attributes: Resources, facilities, resource production, tower and wall</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n<a style="float: right;" href="img/screen_resources.png"><img src="img/screen_resources_s.png" alt="resources"/></a>\r\nEvery player has three types of resources: Bricks, Gems and Recruits, and three types of resource production facilities: Quarry, Magic and Dungeon (generating resources in the corresponding order).\r\nBricks are the basic building material, used mostly for constructing buildings.\r\nMagic powered soul gems (shortly gems) represent the magical power at your disposal.\r\nAnd finally, recruits represent your living or fighting power (ammount of creatures, soldiers and weapons).\r\nAt the end of turn, for each facility of certain type, one resource of the corresponding type is added to the active player''s stock.\r\nExample: If Quarry = 3, at the end of turn, three Bricks will be added to the stock.\r\nThe number of facilities of any kind cannot drop below one, and the ammount of a resource of a certain type cannot be lower than zero. In the picture you can see where resources and facilities info is displayed. Your resources and facilities are to the left and opponent''s  are to the right. Every player has his/her own tower and wall, each having a height. Tower height can be at most 100, wall has height limit 150. In the case of a standard enemy attack, the attack will first lower the wall. Only after the wall height is zero and some attack power still remains will the tower be lowered. Example: Enemy attacks with an attack power of 25, wall height is 10, tower height is 20. After the attack, the wall height will be zero and the tower height will be 5. There are some cards that do damage to the tower directly, bypassing the wall. Tower and wall information are located in the bottom-left part (yours) and bottom-right (opponent''s). Moreover, if some of these game attributes were changed due to effect of some card, it will be indicated. When the game attribute was increased, it will be highlighted with limegreen color, if it was decreased in will be highlighted in orange color.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Victory types</h4>			\r\n<p>\r\nThe goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reaching one or more victory conditions.\r\nThe following outcomes are possible:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<b>tower destruction</b><br/>\r\nRaze the enemy tower to the ground to win - meaning, lower the enemy tower to zero height. Usually achieved by green cards and standard attacks.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<b>tower building</b><br/>\r\nBuild up your tower to height 100 to win. Usually achieved by delaying enemy attacks while building your tower.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<b>resource accumulation</b><br/>\r\nAccumulate 400 of resources (total sum) to win. Beware of cards that cripple your stock.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<b>timeout</b><br/>\r\nEach game is limited to 250 rounds. Afterwards, both players'' states are compared (in the order: tower, wall, no. of facilities, sum of resources). Whoever has more (in that order), wins. Otherwise the game is declared a draw.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nSpecial rules apply in the case where both players achieve a victory condition simultaneously.\r\n<br/>\r\nIf the victory type for both is the same, the result is, logically, a draw.\r\n<br/>\r\nIf the victory types are different, the following rule is used to determine the winner:\r\nDestruction victory > Tower bulding victory > Resource victory > Timeout victory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>After the game is finished and a player leaves the game, his opponent is informed about this with "player has left the game" message in the chat window.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cards</h4>\r\n<p><img style="float: right" src="img/screen_card.png" alt="card"/>Every card has a name, a price and an effect. The name and the price are found in the upper part of the card, the effect in the lower part, below the card picture. The price is the ammount of resources needed for a card to be played, each type of resource represented by the color related to the resource. This ammount will be subtracted from the resource stock when the card is played. The card can only be played if you have enough resources to pay for its price. After a card is played, its effect will take place. Every card belongs to some group, indicated by the card''s border color. There are three groups: Common, Uncommon and Rare. Common cards have green border, Uncommon brown and Rare yellow. Every player has exactly eight cards in his or hers hand. Your cards are located at the upper part of the screen. Opponent''s cards are located in the bottom part of the screen. You can see enemy''s cards in his or hers hand. Some cards in yours/opponent''s hand are marked with "New card" flag. This indicates that this card has been received to the hand only recently. You may want to pay close attention to these cards. In the middle of the game screen are cards last played by each player (it can be very important). In one turn one player plays one card (more if played card says so) or a player can discard a card instead of playing it. When a card is discarded, its cost is not payed, but its effect will not happen. After a card(s) has been played or discarded a new card(s) will be added to player''s hand. The new card will be chosen randomly from the card groups with probabilities 65% for Common, 29% for Uncommon and 6% for Rare, unless a played card says otherwise. Some cards have modes. If a card has more modes, it means it can be played with different effects. The effects are described on the card. For example card Merchant will add 6 bricks, when played in Mode1, 5 gems when played in Mode2 or 5 recruits, when played in mode3. When you can play such card, there is a mode selector next to the play button. Simply select the chosen mode of the card and play it. Some cards discard other cards from yours or opponents hand. Cards that where discarded during your last turn(s) are located to the left of the card history. Cards that were discarded during opponent''s last turn(s) are shown to the right of the card history. One pile of discarded cards are further divided into cards that were discarded from your hand (located on the left of yellow vertical line) and cards that were discarded from opponent''s hand (located on the right of yellow vertical line). Both card history and discarded cards are ordered in this fashion: last played/discarded are the leftmost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Chat</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nYou can chat with other players in the game screen.\r\nSimply write the text in the bottom part of the game and then click the "Send message" button.\r\nFor more comfort you can use some hot keys.\r\nPush Tab (or Alt+a when your browser support keybord shortcuts) to jump into chat window, write the message and then push Tab+Enter (or Alt+s).\r\nThe message itself contains the date and time when it was written and also name of the player who wrote it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Deck building</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n<a style="float: right;" href="img/screen_deck_building.png"><img src="img/screen_deck_building_s.png" alt="deck building section"/></a>\r\nDeck consists of 15 different cards from each group. A deck name must be different to all your other decks. Deck building section consits of control bar, where buttons that provide deck modifications and card pool modifications (filters), are located. On the left part this bar, there are filters. You can use them to filter out the unnecessary cards from the card pool. Just set the filters and then push the "Apply filters" button. On the right part of the bar, there are following buttons: Rename, Reset, Randomize and Finish. To rename deck, simply write the name in the text window and click the "Rename deck" button. If you want to empty your deck just push the "Reset" button. When you don''t want to build the deck yourself you can generate a random deck by pressing the "Randomize" button. "Finish" button will fill all remaining empty slots in your deck with random cards. Finnaly the rightmost is the average cost indicator. It shows you the average price of card per turn. Please do note that this calculation does only take into account card cost, not it''s effect. Below is your deck.  When bulding a deck, each of the 45 card slots is occupied either by some card or just with an ''Empty'' card (signalling an empty card slot). You can transfer a card from card pool by pushing Take button under the card you want to select. If you want to remove a card from your deck push the Return button under the card you whish to be removed. Any changes to the deck are immediately recorded, so it is possible to leave the deck incomplete. Such a deck cannot be used to play a game, though. When starting a game you must choose a deck from the deck list by selecting its name. There is a maximum of eight decks total for one player.\r\n</p>\r\n	\r\n<h4>New game</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nYou can start a new game in two ways.\r\nFirst, you can challenge someone to a game by selecting the challenge button in the User screen, which is in the same line as the player, who you want to challenge. The other option is to go to player''s details and challenge him from there.\r\nThen you need to choose the deck with which you want to play the game.\r\nSecond, you can wait until someone else challenges you and then accept the challenge.\r\nBefore accepting the challenge you also need to choose a deck, with which you want to play.\r\nThe player Which goes first is randomly chosen.\r\nThere is a limit of max. 15 <i>simultaneous</i> games, and only one game per opponent which you initiated (this implies that you can only have 2 parallel games against each person).\r\nUnreplied challenges in your challenge box count as games, so try to accept or reject them as soon as possible.\r\nThere is no restriction to the number of games played per day or against someone, you can play any way you like.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When you have a game where your turn is, it is indicated by animated image ("crossed swords") in the upper part of the screen (navigation bar).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Messages</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the section "Challenges" all chellenges and messages that you recieved are located. When a new challenge/message arrives, you are informed about this in the upper menu bar with a animated image ("letter"). New messages can be written in the players section by selecting the [m] button or in the player''s details section. Also you can reply to any message by selecting the reply button.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Avatar</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the settings section you can upload your own avatar. Avatar must be a jpg, jpeg, png or gif image type, must have at most 10kB and should be 60px X 60px large. If it isn''t, it will be resized to this size. Avatars with inappropriate content will be deleted and could also lead to ban.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Card terminology</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Stock - all three types of resource (Bricks, Gems, Recruits)</li>\r\n	<li>Facilities - all three types of production (Quarry, Magic, Dungeon)</li>\r\n	<li>If we are talking about Tower, Wall, Stock, Facilites ... etc. we are talking about your Tower Wall ... .

"Last turn" refers to whole multi-turn in this case.</li>\r\n	<li>"(max N), (min N)" these are limits applied to each resource type (Bricks, Gems, Recruits). It means that you cannot get more then N of each resource for example.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Forum</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nPlease use English only at all times. Forum is divided into sections.
